Financely

Financely is a full-stack personal finance management application developed as a learning project
to practise modern Java and JavaScript tooling, clean architecture principles.

Purpose

This project was created as a personal learning exercise. 
I built it to gain hands‑on experience designing a full‑stack application that combines 
a relational database, a Spring Boot REST API and a React single‑page interface. While others may still 
find the source useful as a reference, its primary goal is to document my own learning process.

Status

Work in progress. The project is not yet fully-completed.
